## What is the GuessWhoOnline?
Two-player character guessing game. 

## Why was the game created?
The idea for the project came from the desire to play the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F">classic board game Guess Who.</a>

## What is the game about?
1. You have to choose one of 24 characters.
2. Your task is to guess, which character the opponent chose.
3. Ask the questions about the appearance of the opponent’s character, so that it is possible to answer "yes” or “no”
For instance:
-Does your character have brown hair?
-yes 
4. After asking a question, delete mismatched characters by clicking in character. If you’re not sure, the next click will set the question mark on the character and then, click finish turn.
5. If you are sure about your opponent’s character, you can guess by selecting the name of the character and then, confirm your choice by clicking the button “Guess”.
6. If you guessed correctly, you won, if not, you lose.
